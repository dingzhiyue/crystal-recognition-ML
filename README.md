# crystal-recognition-ML
implement crystalization recognition for plasma crystal based on 'Machine-learning approach for local classification of crystalline structures in multiphase systems'

'build_crystal_lattice.py' simulates crystal lattice of different structures (fcc, bcc or hcp) with desired level of noise. 
'pre_process' calculates the features (from 'features_extraction.py') and distinguishes the boundary particles whose voronoi cell is not complete.
